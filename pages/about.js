        I learned front-end web design from scratch when I was put in charge of
        editing the webiste of the non-profit intered at. Coding became a fun
        new, creative outlet for me. I enrolled in Tech Elevator to learn more
        about full-stack web development. After completing the program, I got my
        first developer role at Civil and Environmental Consultants, Inc. I am
        passionate about using technology to make tools for arts management and
        education organizations.
